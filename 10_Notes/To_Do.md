# To Do

- urllib -> browse package (q&d - 10 min)

- in urllib.request ... what does urlopen do specifically? what type of object does it return?

- bs4 - read documentation (15 min). what type of objects does it return / deal with / etc...?

- regex - see the regex notes I made specifically for this. At the top of that I have 2 links to learn more about it. There is super interesting things to do with it - advanced stuff. But I should only get to it once I have really good practice.
